# Wallet Preparation (Abstract Model)

This section covers the essential steps and decisions for setting up a zoning-based multisig wallet. Although funds are not at risk during this phase, the choices made here will define the wallet’s long-term security and usability.

---

## 1. Scope and Assumptions

This document is **model-level and vendor-neutral**. It does not describe step-by-step instructions, user interfaces, or specific software commands.

This model does **not** pursue ultimate technical purity. Instead, it intentionally balances **security and ease of use**. The objective is to provide a **user-friendly way to deploy multisignature wallets** that remains highly survivable under realistic threat scenarios.

Assumptions:

- Seed phrases are generated by reputable hardware wallets
- The coordinating computer and wallet software are **non-authoritative for security-critical decisions**
- Multisig is used for structural separation and recovery, not to eliminate all trust

---

## 2. Wallet Software (Coordinator) Role

The wallet software acts as a **coordinator**, not a trust anchor.

Its responsibilities are:

- Maintaining wallet state (multisig policy, descriptors, labels)
- Constructing and relaying PSBTs
- Providing visibility into wallet structure

The coordinator is **non-authoritative** for security-critical decisions. Loss or compromise of the coordinator must not result in loss of funds.

---

## 3. Hardware Signer Requirements

Not all hardware wallets are suitable for this model.

Each hardware signer must be able to:

- Display the multisig policy and cosigner set on-device
- Store (register) the multisig wallet configuration locally

This ensures that each signer has an independent, persistent view of the wallet.

As a result:

- A compromised coordinator cannot silently change the wallet configuration
- Signing devices can verify addresses and signing requests against their own stored configuration (e.g., verifying change addresses without relying on inputs from the coordinator or other signers)

> *Non-normative note:* At the time of writing, hardware wallets that support on-device multisig registration and verification include BitBox02, COLDCARD Q, and Blockstream Jade. Among these, **COLDCARD Q stands out for ease of use in multisignature workflows**. This list is illustrative, not exhaustive.

## 4. Vendor Uniformity vs Vendor Diversity

This model acknowledges **vendor risk** as a real and valid risk.

Using a single hardware wallet vendor concentrates implementation (including firmware) and supply-chain risk. This risk is **not eliminated**, but it is deliberately **managed** rather than avoided. In this model, vendor risk is partially mitigated through the use of **strong, user-generated signing passphrases**.

The decision to allow a single-vendor setup represents a **conscious trade-off**. It accepts residual vendor risk in exchange for meaningful benefits:

- Reduced operational complexity
- More consistent workflows across signers
- Clearer recovery and inheritance paths

Vendor diversity can reduce correlated supply-chain risk, but it also introduces real drawbacks:

- Increased cognitive and operational complexity
- Potential introduction of a weak link

In an m-of-n multisignature system, an attacker only needs to compromise the **m easiest signers**. Overall security is therefore bounded by the weakest signing component. Vendor diversity may be added as optional hardening, but it is **not a default requirement** for this model.

---

## 5. Seed Generation Assumptions

Users are **not required** to generate their own seed phrases.

Seed generation is left to reputable hardware wallets to perform their intended role: generating a seed phrase inside the device. This model does not attempt to replace or second-guess that process.

At the same time, the model does not rely solely on device-generated entropy. Additional **user-introduced entropy** is deliberately added through the use of strong, user-generated **signing passphrases**. This layered approach reduces reliance on any single entropy source while keeping the setup practical and user-friendly.

Requiring users to manually construct seed phrases would significantly increase complexity and error risk, and would move beyond the intended scope of this model.

---

## 6. Signing Passphrase Strategy

User-generated entropy is applied to **signing passphrases**, in addition to device-generated seeds.

Principles:

- Passphrases are generated using **physical randomness** (dice) mapped to a **Diceware-style word list**
- Passphrase length is flexible and should be chosen based on the user’s threat model (commonly **4 to 12 words**, subject to device support)
- Passphrases are used for **signing** (a seed phrase alone is insufficient to authorize spending without the passphrase)

Purpose:

- Add user-controlled entropy on top of device-generated seeds
- Gate signing so that seed exposure alone does not enable spending
- Reduce the impact of device/seed compromise **if the passphrase is not co-located** with the compromised item/zone

Passphrases should be **physically backed up** alongside:

- Device passwords or PINs
- Wallet documentation
- Recovery instructions

## 7. Freezing the Wallet Structure

After preparation and verification:

- The wallet structure is considered **frozen**
- Keys are not added or removed
- Thresholds are not changed

Any structural change requires creating a **new wallet** and repeating the preparation process.

---

## 8. Verification Before Funding

No funds are deposited until:

- All signers have registered the multisig wallet
- The signing passphrase has been set and backed up
- The recovery path has been reviewed conceptually

Preparation is complete only when the wallet can be **lost, recovered, and reassembled on paper**.

---

## 9. Closing Note

This model intentionally avoids chasing absolute technical purity at the expense of usability. Security that cannot be applied consistently over time is not effective security.

Wallet preparation is about making **explicit, durable trade-offs**: accepting some residual risks in exchange for a system that can be correctly operated, maintained, and recovered—by the user and by heirs—over long time horizons.

Errors made during preparation are permanent. A careful, disciplined preparation process is therefore the single most important control in the entire model.
